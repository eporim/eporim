# Hello! 👋️

![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=eporim&color=AF8E80)

I’m a software engineer from Romania, focused on building fast, beautiful, and high-quality web apps. 
Most of my work has been done in full-time roles, but I’ve recently started exploring some side projects on Github. 
I'm currently learning three.js, as I have a passion for creative web development.
My stack includes tools like Next.js, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS, and I’m mostly focused on creating web apps that leverage these technologies. 
That said, I’d also be open to exploring projects that use React and JavaScript, provided they follow modern development practices.
