# Hello! 👋️

![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=eporim&color=AF8E80)

I’m a software engineer from Romania, focused on building fast, beautiful, and high-quality web apps. 
Most of my work has been done in full-time roles, but I’ve recently started exploring some side projects on Github. 
My stack includes modern tools like Next.js, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS.
I'm currently learning three.js. Looking to collaborate on NodeJS projects mostly.
